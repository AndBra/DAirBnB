# DAirBnB

Decentralized AirBnB application is developped on two stages the user interface and the backend smart contract developed with smartPy language in the tezos blockchain.


Backend:

The smart contract is deployed in Babylonnet tezos testnet using tezos faucet public and private keys.
we used smartPy to implement the smart contract for the simple manual user the tezos community offer as well as the online simulator that is very helpful to test and deploy your contract easily.

User Interface:
the user interface is developped using HTML5 and JavaScript, 
the user can interact with the contract as a Host or Guest or Nuki:
Guest is the user offering his property for rent.
Host is the user looking for a property to rent via a blockchain system.
Nuki is a simulation of smart lock that invoke the smart contract when the Host open the property door.

Bridging:
We used ConseilJs to interact with the contract on the HTML user Interface.
